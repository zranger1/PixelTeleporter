# PixelTeleporter Servers
A PixelTeleporter server is a small program, available for several types
of computer, microcontroller and operatings system. It reads pixel output from an LED
controller, converts it to a network-compatible format, and sends it on request
to one or more client computers.

The currently available servers versions are:
- **[ESP8266](./ESP8266)** (no additional hardware required.)
- **[Raspberry Pi](./Pi)** (uses Pi serial input, requires 5v -> 3.3v converter)
- **[Linux](./Linux)** (requires an FTDI or similar USB-to-Serial converter)
- **[Windows](./Windows)** (requires an FTDI or similar USB-to-Serial converter)

Instructions for installing and configuring each server type are in the 
README in the server's directory, or in the server's downloadable
package in the repository's RELEASES area.
